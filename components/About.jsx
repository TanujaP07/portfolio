            I have a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. I worked for 1 year during my 4th year of undergrad. 
            I also worked as a Graduate teaching assistant at UNT for the department of Computer Science where I was responsible for managing 
            over 600 students and taking classes over a period of 1.5 years. I worked with professors for courses like Fundamentals of Databases, Human Computer Interfaces and Secure E-commerce,
            I specialize in building web and mobile responsive front-end UI applications that connect with APIâ€™s and other backend technologies. 
            I am a quick learner and am passionate about learning new technologies, can pick up new tech developments as needed. 
            I also understand there is always more than one way to accomplish a task. 
            Though I have always been more focused on front-end technologies and frameworks like NextJs, Angular, React, 
            I would like to start working on the back-end too.
            I believe that being a great developer is not just being able to use one specific language, 
            but being able to choose the best tool for the job.

            I started web developement in 2013 managing multiple e-commerce
            websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and
            Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
            time I work on Leetcode, freelance and also have a art page on Instagram where I post my sketches.
